Project topic: Road accidents in UK and different factors contributing to cause of accidents.

Project description: 

Background: We have the accidents dataset that has multiple factors, and we have dataset with 307973 and total 23 columns and we are trying to find those factors relation to accidents in UK.

Aims: -
•	Accidents by month over period of 2021 and 2022
•	Accidents relation to weather conditions versus severity of accidents
•	Accidents relation to urban or rural area
•	Total number of casualties by month in 2021 and 2022 by road type
•	Accidents by Light conditions
•	Number of accidents relation by Road Surface Conditions
•	Number of accidents by severity

Methodology:
Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy and numpy

Outcomes:
Importance of doing this analysis: 
This analysis will help us to find six main factors mentioned above effecting accidents in UK and their relation to it as per the “Road accident dataset”
Expectations:
1.	Poor weather leads to more accidents and severity of accidents
2.	Urban areas have more accidents than rural areas
3.	More casualties happen on single carriageway road
4.	Poor lighting leads to more accidents
5.	Poor road condition leads to more accidents
6.	Slight severity accidents happen more
